# Team 6 CV

**About Us**

We are all-round team consisting of an n-year student, few newcomers and one medical doctor to keep an eye on us. Diversity is a clear strength of our team since about half of us is already working in the industry and other half is excided to learn as much new as they can. We have multidiscplinary skills but what unites us is a big interest in software development.
We are looking for a project that fullfills our wide interests. Fullstack and machine learning with a touch of neural networks are something that we would like to work with.

TLDR;
1. A lot of working experience
2. Interested in fullstack + machine learning = megastack
