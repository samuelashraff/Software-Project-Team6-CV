# Team 6 CV

**About Us**
We are an all-round team consisting of an n-year student, few newcomers and one medical doctor to keep an eye on us. Diversity is a clear strength of our team since about half of us are already working in the industry and the other half is excited to learn as much as they can. We have multidiscplinary skills, but what unites us is a big interest in software development.

We are a team of computer science students with proficiencies ranging from Machine Learning to Web Development.
